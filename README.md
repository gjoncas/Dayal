# Dayal - An Introduction to R for Quantitative Economics
Dayal's <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-81-322-2340-5">book</a> is a beautiful little primer on R, based on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/index.html">Mosaic</a> package.
<br>However, some of the code doesn't work, and several datasets are unavailable.

Here I'll try to fix up the code, and post corrections that work for R version 3.4.3.
<br>As of now, ch. 5-6 and 11-12 still have problems.

Obviously, all copyright goes to Dayal, Springer, and the makers of each dataset.
